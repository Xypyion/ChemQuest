 * Seeds the teacher account and a set of sample chemistry levels so the game

 * "line" (with an optional image) or a "video" — so the teacher controls
 * exactly where a video appears (mid-story, or right before the quiz).

 * NOTE: the YouTube links below are sample demo videos. The teacher can swap
